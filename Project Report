Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning (Linear Regression and LSTM)

Project Report:
1. Introduction:
The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on Linear Regression and deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Stock market predictions are complex due to the volatile and nonlinear nature of financial markets. This project demonstrates how simple regression and deep learning can be applied to forecast future prices using historical stock data.

2. Problem Statement:
Stock prices fluctuate due to several factors like market sentiment, financial reports, global news, and economic indicators. Predicting future stock prices is crucial for financial decision-making. This project aims to:

Predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
Implement machine learning and deep learning models to improve predictions.
3. Dataset:
For the linear regression model, the project uses synthetic stock price data generated programmatically (in the absence of an actual CSV file). However, the model can be adapted to real-world stock datasets from financial APIs or CSV files for better accuracy.

4. Methodology:
Linear Regression: A simple linear model is first used to predict stock prices. The model is trained on a set of historical stock prices to predict the next day's price.
Deep Learning (LSTM): LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), is used for time series forecasting. It can "remember" patterns and trends, making it ideal for predicting stock price movements.

5. Libraries Used:
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
sklearn: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
tensorflow: For building and training deep learning models (LSTM).
MinMaxScaler: To normalize features.
6. Model Evaluation:
The linear regression model achieves decent accuracy for predicting the next day's stock price.
The LSTM model provides better performance for time-series forecasting as it captures temporal dependencies.

7. Results:
The results from both models are compared using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The LSTM model shows a lower error rate, demonstrating its suitability for stock price predictions.

8. Conclusion:
The project showcases a basic implementation of stock price prediction using machine learning and deep learning. It demonstrates that although linear regression can provide initial insights, advanced models like LSTM are more suited for capturing the complexities of stock market data.

9. Future Work:
Implementing real-time data analysis using stock APIs.
Improving model accuracy by incorporating technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and volume.
Building a complete financial dashboard with predictions.
